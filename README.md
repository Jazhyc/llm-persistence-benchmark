# Evaluation of Cybersecurity Persistence Risk in Large Language Models

In this project, we create a benchmark to evaluate the ability of a Large Language Model to maintain long term control over a target system even after system disruptions like a reboot. We utilize a AWS based virtual machine to facilitate this task along with replicate. 

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository was created during a 48 hour hackathon where we had to cut several corners. We cannot guarantee that the code will work properly especially with the regards to the usage of the virtual machine
